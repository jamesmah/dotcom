The\n      CSS prop brings back memories of the early days of styling React\n      components using inline styling, except now you have access to all if not\n      most of what stylesheets and SCSS can do (e.g. nesting, media queries,\n      selectors, the list goes on....).\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      CSS-in-JS solutions are very powerful because they give you the ability to\n      manipulate styles using Javascript in a more direct way. However, similar\n      to writing CSS class names, most recommended CSS-in-JS methods still\n      require you to create a whole bunch of new variables or components, and\n      naming things is always a struggle in programming. So why do it at all?\n      The CSS prop lets you simply add styles to native JSX components without\n      having to add all the boilerplate code when creating new styled components\n      and also avoid having to pass custom props in.\n    </p>\n\n    <img src={image02} />\n\n    <p>\n      You still have access to the theme for consistency and all of Javascript\n      without the overhead. While you might argue that there should be a\n      separation of concerns and styling doesn’t belong on markup, I would say\n      that using the CSS prop comes with a useful side effect of encouraging\n      code reusability. Since you don’t have the convenience of simply pasting\n      the same class name all over your markup, you are more likely to extract\n      and reuse React components instead, making your markup much more modular.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I have seen many React codebases, and because of how the files are\n      normally structured, people tend to have too much business logic tangled\n      into the markup. Frameworks such as Angular and Vue tend to prevent this a\n      little more because there is no Javascript in their markup syntax.\n      However, React markup IS Javascript. Between marrying business logic and\n      markup compared to styling and markup, the latter just makes a lot more\n      sense. The CSS prop is just another reason why you should do so.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Nothing great comes for free, and this feature isn’t ready for use out of\n      the box after installing Styled Components in your project. You will have\n      to add a Babel plugin in your configuration, and if you’re using\n      Typescript, add this into one of your types files:\n    </p>\n\n    <code>{`/// <reference types=\"styled-components/cssprop\" />`}</code>\n\n    <p>\n      For small projects, when I’m working solo or if performance isn’t of\n      utmost importance, this is my go-to choice for styling in React. Not\n      having to open separate style sheets, think of new class names and then\n      add them to the markup is just wonderful. Not to mention, you will never\n      get into trouble with those pesky class name typos again.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>For more, visit the official documentation for using CSS prop:</p>\n\n    <a\n      href={`https://styled-components.com/docs/api#css-prop`}\n      rel={`noreferrer`}\n      target={`_blank`}\n    >\n      https://styled-components.com/docs/api#css-prop\n    </a>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <ImageAuthor\n      authorLink={`https://www.pexels.com/@steve`}\n      authorName={`Steve Johnson`}\n      image={data.image}\n      imageLink={`https://www.pexels.com/photo/multicolored-abstract-painting-1269968/`}\n    />\n  </Stack>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
