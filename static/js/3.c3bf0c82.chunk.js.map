That's fine except you'll fail all the\n        time then. You just won't know it until you fail so badly that you're\n        done.

His views\n      on human psychology and society may be rather controversial to some.\n      However, if you were to go a little deeper into his rationale, they would\n      start to appear quite dangerously logical, even if some ideas aren't\n      entirely practical today. Regardless of whether I agree or disagree with\n      some of his viewpoints, Jordan Peterson has inspired me to think\n      differently from before, for the better.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The original words of today's quote were a little harsher and more direct\n      in his lecture, so I changed the wording just slightly to capture the\n      essence of what he was saying in a more subtle manner,\n    </p>\n    <BlockQuote {...data} />\n    <p>\n      People often start by creating schedules that are often difficult,\n      unrealistic or perhaps impossible to achieve. Schedules are meant to work\n      for us, not against us. If we only added boring and repetitive tasks in,\n      it is no wonder we find our schedules boring and repetitive. Instead of\n      planning our path to success, we might have only set up ourselves for\n      failure from day one.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Guilt and the feeling of hopelessness are two huge enemies of motivation,\n      and a way to avoid that is by building small wins throughout your entire\n      journey. If you've never been able to sit down and study for more than\n      twenty minutes, scheduling 5 hours of study a day isn't going to work. Try\n      adding a few minutes a day, and if you continuously achieve that it is\n      going to loop back positively and spiral you upwards.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You are not your own servant. You have to negotiate with yourself to find\n      the right amount of productivity and also have a good life, a life that\n      you'd like to have. There has to be a balance between responsibilities,\n      obligations and doing what you enjoy. With the right ratio between them,\n      doing what you enjoy might feel even better than before since would be\n      compounded with a sense of reward and satisfaction.\n    </p>\n    <ExternalLink href={`https://youtu.be/bCMkhCV2HWE`}>\n      MAKE A DAMN SCHEDULE - Powerful Motivational Video | Jordan Peterson\n    </ExternalLink>\n    <ImageAuthor {...data} />\n  </PageContainer>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
