That isn't going to happen. And often\n          people won't specify their goals too because they don't like to\n          specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and\n          foggy, which is real easy, because that's just a matter of not doing\n          as well, then you don't know when you fail. And people might say,\n          ‚ÄúWell I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful,\n          so I'll keep myself blind about when I fail‚Äù. That's fine except\n          you'll fail all the time then. You just won't know it until you fail\n          so badly that you're done. And that can easily happen by the time\n          you're forty.\n        </q>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>If that didn't wake you up, I don't know what will.</p>\n      <p>\n        This post was rather hard to write in a way because almost every\n        sentence that Jordan Peterson said in this lecture deserves its own\n        post. His views on human psychology and society may be rather\n        controversial to some. However, if you were to go a little deeper into\n        his rationale, they would start to appear quite dangerously logical,\n        even if some ideas aren't entirely practical today. Regardless of\n        whether I agree or disagree with some of his viewpoints, Jordan Peterson\n        has inspired me to think differently from before, for the better.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The original words of today's quote were a little harsher and more\n        direct in his lecture, so I changed the wording just slightly to capture\n        the essence of what he was saying in a more subtle manner,\n      </p>\n      <blockquote data-aos={`fade-right`}>\n        <q>{data.quote}</q>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>\n        People often start by creating schedules that are often difficult,\n        unrealistic or perhaps impossible to achieve. Schedules are meant to\n        work for us, not against us. If we only added boring and repetitive\n        tasks in, it is no wonder we find our schedules boring and repetitive.\n        Instead of planning our path to success, we might have only set up\n        ourselves for failure from day one.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Guilt and the feeling of hopelessness are two huge enemies of\n        motivation, and a way to avoid that is by building small wins throughout\n        your entire journey. If you've never been able to sit down and study for\n        more than twenty minutes, scheduling 5 hours of study a day isn't going\n        to work. Try adding a few minutes a day, and if you continuously achieve\n        that it is going to loop back positively and spiral you upwards.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You are not your own servant. You have to negotiate with yourself to\n        find the right amount of productivity and also have a good life, a life\n        that you'd like to have. There has to be a balance between\n        responsibilities, obligations and doing what you enjoy. With the right\n        ratio between them, doing what you enjoy might feel even better than\n        before since would be compounded with a sense of reward and\n        satisfaction.\n      </p>\n      <a\n        href={`https://youtu.be/bCMkhCV2HWE`}\n        rel={`noreferrer`}\n        target={`_blank`}\n      >\n        üîó&nbsp;&nbsp;MAKE A DAMN SCHEDULE - Powerful Motivational Video |\n        Jordan Peterson\n      </a>\n      <ImageAuthor image={data.image} imageDetails={data.imageDetails} />\n    </Stack>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Page\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
