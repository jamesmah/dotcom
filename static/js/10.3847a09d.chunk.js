However, similar to writing CSS class names, most recommended CSS-in-JS methods still require you to create a whole bunch of new variables or components, and naming things is always a struggle in programming.

While you might argue that there should be a separation of concerns and styling doesn't belong on markup, I would say that using the CSS prop comes with a useful side effect of encouraging code reusability.
