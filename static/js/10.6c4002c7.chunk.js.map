But like anything\n      else in life, overdoing it is counterintuitive, especially in the long\n      run. When you push yourself too hard for too long, stress tends to pile\n      up, and being overly tense usually works against giving your best\n      performance. If you aren't striving and straining and operating at the\n      very limit of your ability, you have room to think and adapt. You have\n      room to evaluate the responses of and interact with the people around you.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Things get worse when you start to deprive yourself of getting enough\n      sleep. With comments such as \"I can sleep when I'm dead\" and \"the most\n      successful CEOs have only four hours' sleep\", it has almost become a\n      competition to see who can get away with the least amount of sleep. The\n      lack of sleep makes you less focused and easily distracted. You become\n      moody and less forgiving towards the people around you.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Schedule your day so that you make most of your key decisions when youâ€™re\n      feeling the most refreshed. Perhaps early in the day before getting other\n      work done, or within a two-hour block after youâ€™ve had your coffee.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A simple rule to follow is the 85% rule. Aim to only expend 15% less than\n      what you perceive as the total amount of energy you have. Strive to feel\n      like you are performing at a steady pace, always with this tiny bit of\n      room to breathe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Identify whatâ€™s essential and trim out the rest without making life\n      difficult for others. Decline invitations to things that arenâ€™t good uses\n      of your time. Take breaks in your day - or in your career. Find ways to\n      remind yourself to simply slow down.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The key to success is finding the right balance between intensity, focus,\n      and relaxation. Youâ€™ll find that over time you will be achieving way more\n      even though you're not trying as hard.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To explore further into this topic, here's a good read:\n      <br />\n      <ExternalLink\n        href={`https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26271987-how-to-be-really-productive`}\n        icon={`ðŸ“š`}\n      >\n        <i>\n          How To Be Really Productive: Achieving Clarity and Getting Results in\n          a World Where Work Never Ends\n        </i>\n      </ExternalLink>\n    </p>\n    <ImageAuthor {...data} />\n  </PageContainer>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
