I highly recommend this\n      book for any software engineer just starting out, or even a few years into\n      the industry.\n    </p>\n    <BlockQuote\n      {...data}\n      quote={\n        <>\n          {data.quote} Job security is gone. The driving force of a career must\n          come from the individual. Remember: Jobs are owned by the company, you\n          own your career!\n        </>\n      }\n    />\n    <p>\n      Limiting yourself on what you can achieve by giving yourself the excuse\n      that something is \"beyond your job scope or pay grade\" is an attitude that\n      can really set you back, especially early in your career. While there are\n      probably many instances that it might technically be true, it shouldn't be\n      your reason as an individual to not pursue the opportunity to do more. It\n      can be a valid reason for your employer to want to prevent you from\n      overstepping your role if it may cause more harm than good to the business\n      though.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you aspire growth, treat working in a company not just as a place for\n      you to trade your productivity for money, but also as a platform to\n      develop your experience and achievements as an individual. Use David\n      Goggin's cookie jar method (\n      <a\n        href={`https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me`}\n        rel={`noreferrer`}\n        target={`_blank`}\n      >\n        <i>read more about it in his book</i>\n      </a>\n      ) and place all your growth and victories in there. Even when feel that\n      you might not be receiving the recognition or compensation that you\n      deserve, deliberate underperforming not only hurts your employer, but also\n      hurts your own career. Choose to work hard, not solely for your company or\n      your salary, but also for yourself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One of the best ways to get to where you want to be is to act like you are\n      already there. It is very likely that if you step up, your company will\n      take notice and give you that promotion. On the other hand, it is much\n      harder for things to work out in the reverse order (get promotion first\n      then step up), even though it is what most people expect from their\n      employers. If you stand in their shoes, where would you find the\n      confidence of knowing that your employee will do a good job in the new\n      role without ever proving themselves first? However, if you find that your\n      employer doesn't appreciate the work that you do even after some time, it\n      might be a good time to move on. And bring that cookie jar with you.\n    </p>\n    <ImageAuthor {...data} />\n  </PageContainer>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
