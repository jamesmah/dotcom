If you are alive, you are going to have to, or\n      you've already had to, deal with some tough times. The amount of suffering\n      people go through depend less on what challenges they face, but rather,\n      {` `}\n      <i>how</i> they face challenges in their lives. Here are the three most\n      powerful mindsets to have in difficult moments:\n    </p>\n    <h4>1. Resilient people get that shit happens</h4>\n    <p>\n      Suffering is part of life. Some think that they are entitled to a happy\n      and perfect life but the fact is terrible things happen to everyone. In a\n      different light, it is suffering that has made us who we are, and it is\n      suffering that reminds us of what we hold dear to our hearts. This doesn't\n      mean you should actually welcome it in. Just accept the reality of things\n      when they happen.\n    </p>\n    <h4>\n      2. Resilient people are good at choosing where they select their attention\n    </h4>\n    <p>\n      For most of us, it seems much easier to notice the negative, while\n      positive emotions don't seem to last very long. Tuning in to the good\n      takes practice and is an important skill to have when going through hard\n      times. It isn't necessary to eliminate all negative thoughts, just\n      remember to include the good ones as well. And when you have the capacity\n      to take action, focus on the things that you can change and accept the\n      things that you can't.\n    </p>\n    <h4>\n      3. Resilient people ask themselves is what Iâ€™m doing helping or harming me\n    </h4>\n    <p>\n      Ask yourself whether what you're doing, the way you're thinking, the way\n      you're acting is helping or harming you. This is very powerful in many\n      different contexts, all from the smallest to the biggest decisions you\n      have to make. Even in the heat of the moment, asking yourself this puts\n      you back in the driver's seat. It gives you some level of control and can\n      prevent you from doing things you'll regret.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      These strategies don't necessarily remove the pain. They teach us how to\n      accept it by embracing both the good and the bad that life throws at us.\n      The best part is, these ways of thinking are pretty simple to learn and\n      are readily available to us all, anytime, anywhere.\n    </p>\n    <ExternalLink\n      href={`https://www.ted.com/talks/lucy_hone_3_secrets_of_resilient_people`}\n    >\n      Lucy Hone: 3 secrets of resilient people | TED Talk\n    </ExternalLink>\n    <ImageAuthor {...data} />\n  </PageContainer>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
