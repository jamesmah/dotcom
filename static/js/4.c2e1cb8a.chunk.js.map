It might be simpler than you\n      think. There are many things that we think we want in life, such as fame,\n      wealth, recognition, success. But have you ever noticed, that when we\n      achieve some of those major life goals, we get ecstatic for just a brief\n      moment? And before you know it we've moved on to the next thing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I have been lucky enough to have stumbled upon one of the most impactful\n      TED talks that I've watched in my life. Presented by Robert Waldinger, a\n      psychiatrist and Professor at Harvard Medical School. He shares his\n      findings from the Grant Study, a longitudinal study on adult happiness\n      that has been running continuously since 1938.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The conclusion of the study is this.{` `}\n      <i>Good relationships keep us happier and healthier</i>.\n    </p>\n    <p>Three important lessons learned from the study:</p>\n    <ul className={`no-margin`}>\n      <li>Social connections are good, loneliness kills</li>\n      <li>Quality of your close relationships matters</li>\n      <li>Close relationships protect our bodies and brains</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Besides having great relationships with family, friends and workmates, the\n      happiest people are the ones who actively work towards building new\n      relationships as they move towards different stages in their lives.\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the talk, Robert closes with a beautiful quote:</p>\n    <blockquote data-aos={`fade-right`}>\n      <q>{data.quote}</q> - Mark Twain\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Click below to watch the full video:</p>\n    <a\n      href={`https://youtu.be/8KkKuTCFvzI`}\n      rel={`noreferrer`}\n      target={`_blank`}\n    >\n      ðŸ”—&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Waldinger: What makes a good life?
