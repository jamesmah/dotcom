Make your home a safe space</h4>\n    <p>\n      Your home should be a place where you can relax and unwind, where you can\n      find a sense of calm after accumulating stressors when you are out of the\n      house. If you don't live alone, have an honest and open conversation with\n      those you live with to set boundaries for a time or space for you to\n      completely unwind without distractions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Ensure that your home gives you a sense of safety, both physically and\n      emotionally. You could install security systems and stronger locks, hang\n      photos of the people you care about in your life to remind yourself that\n      you are loved or use a weighted blanket. Find what works for you.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Define each room of the house based on its purpose. This is important\n      whether you work from home or not. Set aside a safe space of any size to\n      enhance the sense of calm when you enter this place. It is important to be\n      clear about what activities are allowed in your safe space. As a strictly\n      stress-free zone, no work or technology associated items or thoughts\n      should enter this space. Your brain learns to associate certain areas with\n      different mental states, giving you the ability to unwind when you need\n      to.\n    </p>\n    <h4>2. Make your home interesting</h4>\n    <p>\n      The second step is to make each zone in your house appealing. It won't be\n      very effective to have different zones if some of them are dull or\n      unpleasant. Keep each room clean and fit for purpose. Display your\n      favourite items and pictures up. Invest in good quality and aesthetically\n      pleasing furniture. Use oil diffusers or candles in your safe space to\n      promote relaxation. Indoor plants make your home greener, with the added\n      bonus of filtering and purifying the air. Clean up your home and you will\n      clean up your mind.\n    </p>\n    <h4>3. Do what you enjoy</h4>\n    <p>\n      Don't waste your time on leisure activities you don't enjoy. This might\n      seem rather obvious but many of us simply conform to societal norms even\n      when it comes to having fun. When we think of leisure activities, it would\n      be common to go to the movies, have a meal at a restaurant or travel\n      somewhere. It wouldn't be surprising if you came back from a two week\n      vacation in Paris and didn't feel refreshed at all. Not everyone enjoys\n      the same things, and you need to find what helps <i>you</i> unwind.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you haven't already found something that truly helps you relax, take\n      some time to discover new activities. Maybe even try doing nothing at all.\n      Create a true distinction between leisure and effort. For example, going\n      out for drinks with friends might help some people recharge, but be tiring\n      for others. This doesn't mean that the latter group of people don't get\n      any enjoyment out of it. Just that for those who this group in particular,\n      it is probably best for them to still find some other time to wind down\n      too.\n    </p>\n    <h4>4. Progressive muscle relaxation</h4>\n    <p>\n      Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple practice of tensing and then\n      releasing one muscle group at a time. Doing so can help relax your muscles\n      and the mind. It only takes about 15 minutes a day and has been proven to\n      decrease stress and anxiety when added to your daily routine. Here is a\n      link to a video for guided progressive muscle relaxation:\n    </p>\n    <ExternalLink href={`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86HUcX8ZtAk`}>\n      Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n    </ExternalLink>\n    <p>\n      These techniques might work very well for some and less for others but the\n      key point is that having the ability to wind down is vital if your goal is\n      to increase productivity in a sustainable way. How your mind reacts to\n      different activities and environments change over time so stay curious and\n      take the time to learn what works for you.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <ImageAuthor {...data} />\n  </PageContainer>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n","import React from \"react\"\n\nconst ExternalLink = ({\n  href,\n  icon = `ðŸ”—`,\n  children,\n}: {\n  href: string\n  icon?: string\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) => (\n  <a href={href} rel={`noreferrer`} target={`_blank`}>\n    {icon && <>{icon}&nbsp;</>}\n    {children}\n  </a>\n)\n\nexport default ExternalLink\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
