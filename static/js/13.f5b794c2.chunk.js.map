Though online games are no longer\n      our only source of entertainment anymore, it's still a great way to have\n      fun and bond with people around the world. Remote work has become the norm\n      in many workplaces now, and it's a great way to catch up with friends in\n      different countries.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I've narrowed down the games that I've tried over the past year or so and\n      here are all the ones that I had a lot of fun playing that also have\n      high-quality presentation and UI.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h3>1. Among Us</h3>\n    <p>\n      One of the most popular games during the pandemic last year, I'd be\n      surprised if anyone haven't at least heard of it. Among us has similar\n      elements to the social deduction card game Mafia/Werewolf but brings it to\n      a whole new level in terms of interactivity since you play it on an app\n      instead of with physical cards.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There are two roles in the game. Crewmates work together to complete all\n      the tasks on the map, while imposters try to kill all the crewmates\n      without revealing their true identities.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Even though Among Us isn't as popular as it was during the lockdown, it's\n      still a fantastic game that's easy to pick up with great replay value.\n    </p>\n    <img src={amongus} />\n    <a\n      href={`https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/`}\n      rel={`noreferrer`}\n      target={`_blank`}\n    >\n      ðŸ”—&nbsp;&nbsp;Link to Among Us\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <h3>2. Codenames</h3>\n    <p>\n      Probably in the arsenal of every boardgames lover, this game is really\n      easy to recommend both in its physical and online versions. Two teams\n      compete by each having a \"spymaster\" give one-word clues that can point to\n      multiple words on the board for his/her team to guess, while avoiding the\n      words of the other team.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      What's great is that it can be both fun and educational at the same time.\n      You might learn a new word or two along the way, but I think the real\n      value is learning how your friends or colleagues think and what they\n      associate with.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you love this game and would like to try something similar, I would\n      recommend giving Decrypto a go.\n    </p>\n    <img src={codenames} />\n    <a href={`https://codenames.game/`} rel={`noreferrer`} target={`_blank`}>\n      ðŸ”—&nbsp;&nbsp;Link to Codenames\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <h3>3. Gartic.io</h3>\n    <p>\n      A light fun online version of Pictionary. Works great for larger groups\n      and younger kids too. There are many alternatives but I found this site to\n      have an overall better UI and many more categories to choose from. If that\n      is not enough, you can save a custom list of words in your account too.\n    </p>\n    <p>Similar alternatives:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>https://skribbl.io/</li>\n      <li>https://sketchful.io/</li>\n    </ul>\n    <img src={gartic} />\n    <a href={`https://gartic.io/`} rel={`noreferrer`} target={`_blank`}>\n      ðŸ”—&nbsp;&nbsp;Link to Gartic.io\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <h3>4. GeoGuessr</h3>\n    <p>\n      If you like travelling, this is the game for you. Even though this game\n      can get extremely challenging for the geographically impaired like me, it\n      is still fun to explore and learn new places as you go.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There are free games to play on GeoGuessr, but most of the good ones\n      require a subscription. There is a free trial and it's only $3 a month\n      after that which doesn't break the bank. If anything, learning about new\n      places might inspire you to plan your next travel adventure, and that will\n      definitely cost a little more.\n    </p>\n    <img src={geoguessr} />\n    <a href={`https://www.geoguessr.com/`} rel={`noreferrer`} target={`_blank`}>\n      ðŸ”—&nbsp;&nbsp;Link to GeoGuessr\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <h3>5. Really Boring Website</h3>\n    <p>\n      Contrary to its name, this site might actually fix your boredom instead.\n      If you're familiar with Scattergories you'd be able to just right into it\n      without an introduction.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Rules of the game: You are given a letter and 12 categories each round.\n      Answer each category with a word starting with that letter, and the\n      validity of your answers are voted on at the end of each round.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Being just a word game, you'd be surprised how fast paced this game can\n      get. And between all the games on this list, I would think that you'd get\n      the biggest laughs from this one.\n    </p>\n    <img src={scattergories} />\n    <a\n      href={`https://really.boring.website/`}\n      rel={`noreferrer`}\n      target={`_blank`}\n    >\n      ðŸ”—&nbsp;&nbsp;Link to Really Boring Website\n    </a>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Playing games together with the people you know and care about is a great\n      way to reduce stress and have a good laugh together. It has long lasting\n      effects on teamwork and collaboration even after the game is over and\n      you've all gone back to your routines and work life. On top of that, no\n      matter how simple or complex these games are, they can give you enjoyable\n      learning experiences and increase creativity along the way.\n    </p>\n  </PageContainer>\n)\n\nexport default Page\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport { fadeAnimation } from \"../../utils/keyframes\"\nimport Stack from \"./Stack\"\n\nconst PageContainer = ({ children }: { children?: React.ReactNode }) => (\n  <Stack\n    css={`\n      padding-top: 1rem;\n      animation: ${fadeAnimation} 1s ease;\n    `}\n    gap={`1rem`}\n  >\n    {children}\n  </Stack>\n)\n\nexport default PageContainer\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
