      Persistence and hard work are necessary to find success. But like anything
      else in life, overdoing it is counterintuitive, especially in the long
      run. When you push yourself too hard for too long, stress tends to pile
      up, and being overly tense usually works against giving your best
      performance. If you aren't striving and straining and operating at the
      very limit of your ability, you have room to think and adapt. You have
      room to evaluate the responses of and interact with the people around you.

      Things get worse when you start to deprive yourself of getting enough
      sleep. With comments such as "I can sleep when I'm dead" and "the most
      successful CEOs have only four hours' sleep", it has almost become a
      competition to see who can get away with the least amount of sleep. The
      lack of sleep makes you less focused and easily distracted. You become
      moody and less forgiving towards the people around you.

      Schedule your day so that you make most of your key decisions when you're
      feeling the most refreshed. Perhaps early in the day before getting other
      work done, or within a two-hour block after you've had your coffee.

      A simple rule to follow is the 85% rule. Aim to only expend 15% less than
      what you perceive as the total amount of energy you have. Strive to feel
      like you are performing at a steady pace, always with this tiny bit of
      room to breathe.

      Identify what's essential and trim out the rest without making life
      difficult for others. Decline invitations to things that aren't good uses
      of your time. Take breaks in your day - or in your career. Find ways to
      remind yourself to simply slow down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to success is finding the right balance between intensity, focus,
      and relaxation. You'll find that over time you will be achieving way more
      even though you're not trying as hard.
