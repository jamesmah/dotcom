Since certain stimuli can prompt habitual behavior, you can use this to change your habits. For example, you can change your environment to encourage better habits. If you want to exercise more often then leave your running shoes and gym clothes somewhere where you won\u2019t miss them."}),e("p",{children:"If you want to eat healthier food, then put your cut vegetables on the shelf that you see as you open your fridge instead of hiding them in the vegetable drawer."}),e("h4",{children:"2. Second Law - Make It Attractive"}),e("p",{children:"Humans are motivated by the anticipation of reward, so making habits attractive will help you stick to them."}),e("p",{children:"Our brain releases dopamine (a hormone that makes us feel good) when we do activities that we enjoy. However, dopamine is also released when we anticipate these activities not only when we actually do them. That is why planning a vacation is so enjoyable and part of the fun."}),e("p",{children:"We can use this to our advantage when trying to form new habits. If we make a habit something we look forward to, we\u2019ll be much more likely to follow through and actually do it. James Clear suggests using \u201Ctemptation bundling\u201D to do this. Temptation bundling is when you take a behavior that you want to adopt that is unappealing and link it to a behavior that you enjoy (one that will cause your brain to release dopamine). For example, make a decision that you will only watch TV in general or a specific program that you enjoy when you are on the treadmill."}),e("h4",{children:"3. Third Law - Make It Easy"}),e("p",{children:"If you want to build a new habit, make that habit as easy to adopt as possible."}),e("p",{children:"We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Therefore, making behaviors as easy as possible is important to turn them into habits. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible."}),e("p",{children:"If you want to do something, then make sure that the supplies are available so that there\u2019s no friction involved in sending one. For example, if you want to go for a run, then keep your running gear out. If you don\u2019t want to waste time on your phone, then don\u2019t keep it nearby while you are working or simply turn it off. Doing so will introduce enough friction to ensure you only use it when you need to."}),e("p",{children:"This is another way to make any new activity feel manageable. The rule recognizes that simply getting started is the first and most important step toward doing something. If you want to start running then commit to running for two minutes only. Once you start running, you will probably keep going."}),e("h4",{children:"4. Fourth Law - Make It Satisfying"}),e("p",{children:"The most important rule for behavioral change is to make habits satisfying. This can be difficult since our habits are often beneficial in the long run and we don\u2019t always get immediate satisfaction. For example, when we workout every day we will eventually get fitter but we don\u2019t see the change every day. On the other hand, bad habits often do have immediate satisfaction such as the enjoyment from eating chocolate."}),e("p",{children:"Therefore, when you are trying to build habits with a long-term benefit, try to attach some immediate satisfaction to them. For example, if you want to start losing weight, start saving for something that you really want to buy. Each day that you eat well and/or workout put a dollar (or however much you decide on) into the savings account to save for something you really want. You will now get some short-term satisfaction each time you put money into your account. This will keep you on track until you reach your long-term goals."}),e("br",{}),e("b",{children:"How to Break a Bad Habit (inverse):"}),e("h4",{children:"1.
