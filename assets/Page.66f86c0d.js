However, similar to writing CSS class names, most recommended CSS-in-JS methods still require you to create a whole bunch of new variables or components, and naming things is always a struggle in programming.

While you might argue that there should be a separation of concerns and styling doesn't belong on markup, I would say that using the CSS prop comes with a useful side effect of encouraging code reusability.

Frameworks such as Angular and Vue tend to prevent this a little more because there is no Javascript in their markup syntax. However, React markup IS Javascript. Between marrying business logic and markup compared to styling and markup, the latter just makes a lot more sense. The CSS prop is just another reason why you should do so."}),e("p",{children:"Nothing great comes for free, and this feature isn't ready for use out of the box after installing Styled Components in your project.
