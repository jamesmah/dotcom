That isn't going to happen. And often people won't specify their goals too because they don't like to specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy, because that's just a matter of not doing as well, then you don't know when you fail. And people might say, \u201CWell I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful, so I'll keep myself blind about when I fail\u201D. That's fine except you'll fail all the time then.
